# **SentryVault – AI-Driven Decentralized Password Manager with Autonomous Security**

SentryVault redefines digital security through an intelligent, self-protecting password management system that combines cutting-edge AI, decentralized storage, and multi-layered authentication. Unlike traditional password managers, SentryVault employs:

- **Biometric-Semantic Dual Authentication**: Facial recognition (via OpenCV) paired with dynamically generated NLP-validated passphrases ("A violet moon orbits 42 times!") to prevent brute-force and deepfake attacks.
- **Self-Healing Blockchain-Inspired Storage**: Credentials are encrypted using quantum-resistant Argon2/Fernet algorithms, split into shards via Shamir's Secret Sharing, and distributed across IPFS, cloud storage, and local nodes for tamper-evident resilience.
- **AI-Powered Threat Response**: A convolutional neural network monitors access patterns, triggering intruder photo capture, honeypot credential deployment, and cross-platform alerts when anomalies are detected.
- **Context-Aware Decryption**: Requires geolocation validation, device fingerprinting, and time-limited access windows to thwart remote exploitation.

Built with Python’s cryptography stack and machine learning libraries, SentryVault demonstrates how modern security systems can autonomously adapt to threats while maintaining zero-knowledge principles. Its decentralized architecture eliminates single points of failure, and the integration of mutating storage DNA—inspired by biological systems—ensures long-term defense against evolving attack vectors.

This project serves as both a practical security tool and a blueprint for next-generation protection systems, merging cybersecurity fundamentals with emergent technologies like edge AI and decentralized networks. Ideal for developers seeking to explore advanced Python applications in encryption, computer vision, and autonomous systems.

**Impact**: Sets a new standard for proactive digital security while showcasing Python’s capabilities in building enterprise-grade, AI-integrated privacy solutions.
